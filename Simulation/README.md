# Simulation
This folder contains the simulation for IC Model and different Misinformation Mitigation Methods. 
Here's what differnt notebooks contain.

## simulation.ipynb
This has the simulation for Independent Cascade Model (ICM). 
Here 'init_rate' is the initial fraction of seed nodes (sources of misinformation). 

## Edge Blocking Simulation.ipynb
This contains various Edge Blocking Methods. For more information on what different edge blocking methods in the file do see, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08860 

I haven't added node blocking and verifier methods yet. Might add them in future.
