# Datasets
This folder contains the datasets I used in my experiments. The graphs given are in the form, (a b w), where a and b are nodes, which have edges between them, and w is the weight of the edge connceting them.
# Probability Generator.py
This file can be used to get the dataset in the required format. It will calculate the Jaccard-index based weights for the edges, and create a new new file in the required format.
