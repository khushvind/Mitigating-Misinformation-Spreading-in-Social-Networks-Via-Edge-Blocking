# Mitigating-Misinformation-Spreading-in-Social-Networks-Via-Edge-Blocking
Hey! This repository contains the code that I wrote for my research project "Mitigating Misinformation Spreading in Social Networks Via Edge Blocking". The outcome of the project got published at Pacific Rim International Conference on AI (PRICAI) 2023. Here's an extended version of the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08860

I tried to clean the code, before adding it here, this might have generated some unwanted bugs. Let me know if you find them. For now, I have just added the Edge Blocking Methods.

# Content
## Code
Contains the implementation of different edge blocking methods, and diffusion model.

## Data
Contains the datasets used by me in the project. 
You can also download and use your own dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/, https://networkrepository.com/ or any other suitable site. Make sure to generate the edge weights using 'prob_generator.py'. 

## Simulation 
Contains the notebooks, which make it easier to run the simulation, and observe the results.

Make sure that you have the required libraries available in your python environment.
# Python Libraries Required
1. Networkx
2. Numpy
3. Ndlib (optional)
4. collections
5. random
