# Code
This folder contains the implementation of different edge blocking methods, and diffusion model. Here's what each file contains.

## block_edges.py
Contains the implementation of different edge blocking methods.

## block_nodes.py
Contains the implementation of different node blocing methods.

## verifier.py 
Contains the implementation of different verifier methods.

## communities.py
Contains the implementation of community detection, and functions to find inter-community edges.

## data.py 
Contains the implementation of function to assign the weight to the edges and data preprocessing.

## influence.py
Contains the implementation of Independent Cascade Model, and a modefied version of Independent Cascade Model which handles two diffusion process simultaneously (verifier method).
